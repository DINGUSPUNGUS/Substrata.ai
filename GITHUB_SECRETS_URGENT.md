# URGENT: GitHub Repository Secrets Configuration

## CRITICAL: Set these EXACT values in your GitHub repository secrets

### Step 1: Go to your GitHub repository
URL: https://github.com/DINGUSPUNGUS/Substrata.ai/settings/secrets/actions

### Step 2: Create/Update these 3 secrets with EXACT values:

**VERCEL_TOKEN**
```
BA5bI5qDysrjmRJNT6BhyU9z
```

**VERCEL_ORG_ID** 
```
team_81F8nZMv4Mx34I9rC2KRMTI3
```

**VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**
```
prj_DCpw3vw1hMjtWINxa24rOhXTUETD
```

### Step 3: Important Notes
- Click "New repository secret" for each one
- Name must be EXACTLY as shown above (case sensitive)
- Value must be EXACTLY as shown (no extra spaces)
- After setting all 3, push any change to trigger deployment

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ Workflow is simplified and optimized
- ‚ùå GitHub secrets need to be set correctly
- üéØ Once secrets are set, deployment will work immediately

The only issue now is the GitHub repository secrets configuration.
